<h1 > All About Me </h1>

<p> I am originally from Long Valley, New Jersey. <br>
  Growing up I liked to do normal stuff: play sports, <br>
  listen to music, hang out with my friends,<br>
  play videogames, and go to the movies.<br>
  My favorite sports are baseball and basketball<br>
  and my favorite teams are the New York Yankees<br>
  and the Los Angeles Lakers. <br><br>
  My three best friends growing up, Tom, Dave, and Kevin<br>
  are still my best friends to this day. Even though we<br>
  all live in different states, we do our best to meet up<br>
  a few times a year. This past march we were able to all get <br>
  together in Pennsylvania for Dave's wedding, which was quite fun.

<h2>
  My Family
</h2>
<p>
  One of the coolest things that recently happened<br>
  to me was becoming an uncle. The main reason I moved<br>
  to Colorado with my mom was to be able to be with my sister<br>
  as she and her husband started to have kids and raise a family.<br>
  Being an uncle is pretty much all the fun of being a parent,<br>
  but with only like 3-4 percent of the responsibility.<br><br>
  Luckily, I live within walking distance of my sister's house<br>
  so I try to go over several times per week and hang out.<br>
  <br>
