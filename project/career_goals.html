<h1>What's It All About?</h1>
<p style="color:green;"> When I first applied for Galvanize, I kind of kept it a secret from many of my close friends and family members.<br>
  By no means was I embarrassed, quite the opposite actually. I was proud of myself, as were my mother, sister, and brother in law, <br>
  only one of whom actually has a coding background.For years I had kind of been stuck in a job that I was good at and did enjoy, <br>
  but from which I really derived no sense of personal fulfillment, nor did I really see much if any room for advancement or upward mobility.<br>
  When I went to college about 8 years ago, I did take some introductory computer science and some html/javascript, and I did enjoy them, <br>
  but I never really pursued it as a career path, for reasons of which I am unaware.  I graduated with a bachelor's degree in accounting, <br>
  but I never really used it and just wound up working at a Best Buy store, got complacent, and never tried for something more.<br>
  <p style="color:red;">Earlier this year, I did apply for a management position with that company, but when I did not receive it, I finally decided to apply <br>
    for Galvanize to make something more of myself and pursue a better career.I was lucky enough to have the support of my immediate family <br>
    to convince me that this was the right thing to do, becuase changing jobs or careers at any time in life can be somewhat stressful, <br>
    but I had them to reassure me that I was making the right choice. When I submitted the application, received the portfolio instructions, <br>
    read through "Javascript For Kids", and completed lessons on Code Academy, I was sure I had made the right choice.By no means do I think the <br>
    next six months will be easy, but I know the knowledge I will gain, and career paths that I will open up will be well worth the hard work and sacrifice.

<h1> Where Do I Go From Here </h1>
<p> Obviously, the main reason anyone starts a career or switches to a new career is partially for financial reasons.
  I know that even an entry level coder or web deeloper can make a decent salary and with years of hard work and improvement, building a strong skill set, and being able to show a proven track record of effective work, one can do fairly well.
  At 29 years old, I still like to think of myself as relatively "young" per se, and I want to do my best to learn, work hard, and improve for the rest of my life.
  Some concrete goals I have come up with include the following
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Graduate Galvanize in the top 10% percent of my cohort</li>
  <li>Secure a Job with a small to midsize firm upon of graduation</li>
  <li>Secure a job with a  large, well known company like Facebook or Google within 3-5 years</li>
  <li>Start a family, for whom I can provide a good life</li>
  <li>Travel to different countries around the world, to experience different people, food, and cultures</li>
  <li>Last but not least, be happy with my career, with myself, and make my family and friends proud</li>
</ol>
